Well, here we go.  After all my time learning from the good people at Flatiron how to be Fullstack Web Developer, I'm leaving the nest.  I've got to spread my wings...and get a job!  The career guidance I've gotten so far from my coach has been terrific (thanks Heather, if you ever read this).  I'm growing my network on Linkedin -- connecting with great 2nd and 3rd level contacts that I wouldn't have even known existed before!  I didn't imagine that my existing connections (who are mostly personal connections from my church and some high school classmates) would know so many interesting people in the tech field...I just had to look!  I'm not one to use social media of any kind, but I think this job search experience will teach me some things.  I'll be back soon with a technical post next week, based on my continued work on my React project, [MovieLister](http://movie-lister.herokuapp.com/).
